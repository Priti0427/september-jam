Collaboration for TripleTen Code Pudding for September 2025

## Why We Chose This Dataset

We chose the **World Happiness Report dataset** because:

- ✅ **Recent data** – it includes the latest available happiness scores up to **2024**, making the analysis timely and relevant.
- 🌍 **Global coverage** – the dataset contains data from **~150+ countries**, allowing for broad cross-country comparisons.
- 📊 **Rich indicators** – in addition to the main **Life Ladder (happiness score)**, it provides key explanatory factors such as:
  - **Log GDP per capita** (economic prosperity)
  - **Social support** (community strength)
  - **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (health outcomes)
  - **Freedom to make life choices**
  - **Generosity**
  - **Perceptions of corruption**
  - **Positive and Negative affect** (emotional well-being)

Together, these indicators make the dataset ideal for **exploring global happiness trends** and **building predictive models** to understand what truly drives happiness worldwide.
